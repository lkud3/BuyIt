# The repository of my final project on CS300 at American College at Thessaloniki. The showcase of coding in Android Studio and creating my first mobile application.

This project aims to develope skills in Mobile Application Developing on Android Studio. During this work, I enhanced my knowledge in both Kotlin and XML. 

The application represents the basic marketplace business app with an ability to seacrh and buy some goods on the internet. It consists of multiple screens allowing user to see the list of the goods, add
them to cart, saving to favorites and etc. For the list of users and goods omn stock the external database was used build on Firebase. All the images are also stored in the online storage so the 
usage of localy stored images is minimized. 
The JSON depicting the database organization is also attached. 

The Android version is API 27 (Android 8.1)
